				  <b><i>Detecting DGA using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)</i></b>
				<p align="justify">In recent days, malicious authors use domain generation algorithms so that they can easily evade blacklisting and heuristics mechanism. DGAs is used by a larger number of malware families to generate many pseudo-random domain names to connect to C2 server. In this paper, the deep neural network is employed along with 3-gram representation to transform the domain names into numeric representation. Deep neural networks has a certain level of complexity since it uses sophisticated mathematical modelling to process data. The network parameters and network 3-gram representation to transform the domain names into numeric representation. The network parameters and network structures for DNN is selected by following hyper parameter selection method. All experiments are run untill one hundred times with learning rate inside the range [0.01-0.5]. The experiments of DNN are run on DGA corpus given by DMD-2018 shared task organizer.<p>

				  <b><i>A Sequential Labelling Approach for the Named Entity Recognition in Arabic Language Using Deep Learning Algorithms</i></b>
				<p align="justify">Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves finding and categorizing minute text components into pre- defined categories such as name of person, location etc. NER is a type of information extraction task which has a crucial role in improving the performance of various NLP applications. For a morphologically abundant Semitic language like Arabic, the NER task is highly challenging due to its unique morphological characteristics and peculiarities. This paper introduces a deep learning based approach for Arabic NER which make use of well-known deep neural network (DNN) architectures like Recurrent neural network (RNN), Long short term memory (LSTM), Gated recurrent unit (GRU), stacked and bidirectional versions of these three architectures. ANERcorp dataset is used for the evaluation of the Arabic NER model and Accuracy is chosen as the performance metric. On model evaluation, it is observed that bidirectional variants of DNNs provide better accuracy measures compared to their unidirectional variants.<p>

				  <b><i>A deep learning approach for Part-of-Speech tagging in Nepali language</i></b> 
				<p align="justify">Part of Speech (POS) tagging is the most fundamental task in various natural language processing(NLP) applications such as speech recognition, information extraction and retrieval and so on. POS tagging involves annotation of appropriate tag for each token in the corpus based on its context and the syntax of the language. In computational linguistics, optimal POS tagger is of paramount importance since tagging errors can critically affect the performance of the complex NLP systems. Developing an efficient POS tagger for morphologically rich languages like Nepali is a challenging task. In this paper, a deep learning based POS tagger for Nepali text is proposed which is built using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and their bidirectional variants. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score were chosen for the model valuation. It is observed from the results that our model shows significant improvement and outperforms the state-of-art POS taggers with more than 99% accuracy<p>
