				  <b>Detecting DGA using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)</b>
				<p align="justify">In recent days, malicious authors use domain generation algorithms so that they can easily evade blacklisting and heuristics mechanism. DGAs is used by a larger number of malware families to generate many pseudo-random domain names to connect to C2 server. In this paper, the deep neural network is employed along with 3-gram representation to transform the domain names into numeric representation. Deep neural networks has a certain level of complexity since it uses sophisticated mathematical modelling to process data. The network parameters and network 3-gram representation to transform the domain names into numeric representation. The network parameters and network structures for DNN is selected by following hyper parameter selection method. All experiments are run untill one hundred times with learning rate inside the range [0.01-0.5]. The experiments of DNN are run on DGA corpus given by DMD-2018 shared task organizer.<p>

				  <b>AmritaDGA: A Comprehensive Data set for Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)</b>
				<p align="justify">In recent days, botnet plays an important role in malware distribution. This has been
used as a primary approach for the proliferation of the malicious activities via the
internet by attackers. To evade blacklisting, recent botnets make use of domain flux
or internet protocol (IP) flux. This work focuses on domain flux. Domain flux uses
domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a list of domain names based on a
seed and these domain names contacts command and control (C&C) server till it gets
access permission to the system. This work presents the fully labeled domain name
dataset entitled as AmritaDGA which can be used for doing research in the field of
detecting domain names which are generated using DGAs. We evaluate the efficacy
of deep learning architectures with Keras embedding as domain name representation
method on AmritaDGA. AmritaDGA is composed of two data sets. The first data
set is collected from the publicly available sources. The second data set is collected
from an internal network. The performance of the trained model on public data set is
evaluated on unseen samples of a public dataset and private corpora. Deep learning
architectures performed well in most of the cases of test experiments. The baseline
system has been made publicly available and the data set is distributed for DMD-

				  <b>A deep learning approach for Part-of-Speech tagging in Nepali language</b> 
				<p align="justify">Part of Speech (POS) tagging is the most fundamental task in various natural language processing(NLP) applications such as speech recognition, information extraction and retrieval and so on. POS tagging involves annotation of appropriate tag for each token in the corpus based on its context and the syntax of the language. In computational linguistics, optimal POS tagger is of paramount importance since tagging errors can critically affect the performance of the complex NLP systems. Developing an efficient POS tagger for morphologically rich languages like Nepali is a challenging task. In this paper, a deep learning based POS tagger for Nepali text is proposed which is built using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and their bidirectional variants. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score were chosen for the model valuation. It is observed from the results that our model shows significant improvement and outperforms the state-of-art POS taggers with more than 99% accuracy<p>
